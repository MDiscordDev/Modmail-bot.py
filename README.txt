SOURCE CODE: DISCORD.PY MODMAIL BOT BASIC

========================================================

Here is a guide to set up this basic modmail script. Perfect for Beginners
No extra discord server required.

=======================================================

SETUP GUIDE:
1. Fork this Source code (or download it)
2. Copy the entire code from main.py into your hosting provider.
3. At the bottom with "client.run("")", Insert your bot token in between the ""
4. Make a discord text channel called: #modmail
5. Run the Bot

========================================================

How it works.

First, a person can DM the bot and that message will be sent to your #modmail channel

To reply back, you have to mention the user with your message.
ex: @MemberMention Hi

However, I can't find a way to add a user id to the message it sends in the #modmail channel
to do <@!userid> but there is another way to do this.

1. Go to your server Settings and under the "Members" tab, search for that username. After you find the
user, click on the 3 little dots and click "Copy Id" and paste the ID in <@!useridhere>

This is how replies should look
<@!MemberMention> your message here
